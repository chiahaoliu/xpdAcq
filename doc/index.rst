xpdAcq documentation
====================

Introduction
++++++++++++

``xpdAcq`` is a Python package that helps data collection at XPD beamlime. It is built on top of and augments the NSLS-II data acquisition Python
package `bluesky <http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/>`_ .

XPD may be operated directly by bluesky, or using xpdAcq.

The goal of the ``xpdAcq`` package is to simplify your collection and analysis workflow during beamtime,
so that you can focus more on science aspects. ``xpdAcq`` provides an interface for user who don't have extensive Python coding background.

Every syntax started from psychological motivation, like the most important one behind running a
"production" scan, ``prun``:

.. code-block:: none

  run this Sample with this ScanPlan

What's new?
+++++++++++

current version : ``v0.5``

New features introduced to this version:

  * data reduction tools:

    * azimuthal integration using ``pyFAI`` as the back-end
    * auto-masking based on statistics on pixel counts

``v0.5`` supports three kinds of built-in scans:

.. code-block:: none

  single-frame (ct)
  time-series (tseries)

Additional built-in scan types will be added in future releases.

``v0.5`` supports following automated logics :
